When it appears to the left, it looks like a hiragana ne (ネ) with an extra drop on the right, and we shall take it to mean _cloak_.  At the bottom, when attached to the stroke immediately above it, the first two strokes (the _top hat_ ) are omitted, which we shall take to mean a _scarf_.

(This meaning accords well with Japan, where the output of _rice_ far exceeds that of _wheat_.) It occasionally takes a different shape when it stands on its own, or is joined to a line above. In this case, we shall have it refer specifically to _grains of rice_. This primitive is not to be confused with the similar-looking primitive for _water_. While the stroke orders are nearly alike, _grains of rice_ has 5 strokes, while _water_ only has 4 because it joins the second and third strokes into one. Finally, we may note that by itself the kanji for _rice_ is an abbreviation used for the _United States_ , which can then also serve as an alternate reading for the main primitive form, if you so wish."

    "comment": "* As a primitive, it can keep its kanji form except when it appears to the left (its normal position), where it is made to stand up in the form ⺅ (Similar to イ). The primitive meaning is another matter. The abstract notion of _person_ so often has a relation to the meaning of the kanji that confusion readily sets in. So many of the previous stories have included people in them that simply to use _person_ for a primitive meaning would be risky. We need to be more specific, to focus on one particular _person_. Try to choose someone who has not figured in the stories so far, perhaps a colorful member of the family or a friend whom you have known for a long time. That individual will appear again and again, so be sure to choose someone who excites your imagination."

The picture of **gloom** begins with a small _grove_ of trees, under which we see a _crown_ made out of used _tin cans_. Next (the lower half of the kanji) we find a combination that appears only a few times in modern characters and only once in those treated in the volumes of _Remembering the Kanji_. It is composed of a _shovel_ with a _sheaf_ dotted with small _drops_ on all sides. Think of it as a large scoop _shovel_ attached to the front of a bulldozer, whose driver is singing: ♪  \"Bulldozing in the _sheaves_ , bulldozing in the _sheaves_... \" ♪ The _drops_ represent the chaff flying about as the _sheaves_ are tossed about by the heavy machinery. There is _someone sitting on the ground_ alongside, watching as the machinery makes its way around the neighboring farmland - and it's you, wearing your _tin-can crown_. You feel overwhelmed by the impending doom as the invasion of agro- business draws closer and closer to the _grove_ , the only patch of woods that remains of what once was a vast forest. The whole scene represents a re- _shaping_ of the natural environment that brings the heavy weight of **gloom** down upon you.
